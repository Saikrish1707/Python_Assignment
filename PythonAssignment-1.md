## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
	
	Because python is a interpreted language and its interpreter run through the code and translates the code into machine readable byte code.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
	
	Because Python interpreter does type checking only as code runs, and the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
	
	Pros:
	1. Easy to Read, Learn and Write
	2. Improved Productivity
	3. Interpreted Language
	4. Dynamically Typed
	5. Free and Open-Source
	6. Vast Libraries Support
	7. Portability
	
	Cons:
	1. Slow Speed
	2. Not Memory Efficient
	3. Database Access
	4. Runtime Errors

	Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, & Deep learning, 

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
	
	A Python variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object. 
	Declaring a variable : 
	1. Name the variable
	2. Assign a value to the variable

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
	
	By using the input function (i.e input())

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
	
	String

Q8. What is type casting?
	
	converting the datatype from one to other datatype (i.e number 13 can be converted to string 13 by using type() function)

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
	
	Yes,  by using ==> a, b, c = input().split() 

Q10. What are keywords?
	 
	 Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in Python programming that have special meanings to the compiler

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
	 
	 No, Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in programming that have special meanings to the compiler.
	 

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
	 
	 Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. The use of indentaion is to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
	 
	 By using print function (i.e print())

Q14. What are operators in Python?
	 
	 Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation
	 +,-,*,/,//,%,**


Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
	 
	 /  ==> Divide left operand by the right one 
	 // ==> Floor division - division that results into whole number adjusted to the left in the number line

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
	
	 str = 'iNeuron'
	 print(str*4)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
	 
	 num = int(input("Please enter a number : "))
	 if num % 2 == 0:
		print("The entered number is EVEN")
	 else:
		print("The entered number is ODD")

Q18. What are boolean operator?
	 
	 Boolean operators are those that take Boolean inputs and return Boolean results.
	 NOT, AND, OR

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 ==> 1

0 and 0 ==> 0

True and False and True  ==> False 

1 or 0 or 0 ==> 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
	 
	 Conditional Statements are used to handle conditions in your program. 
	 These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions defined in the program.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
	 
	 IF ==> It checks for a given condition, if the condition is true, then the set of code present inside the "if" block will be executed otherwise not.
	 ELIF ==> "elif" statement is used to check multiple conditions only if the given condition is false. 
			  Itâ€™s similar to an "if-else" statement and the only difference is that in "else" we will not check the condition but in "elif" we will check 				the condition.
	 ELSE ==> "else" block will be directed to perform the action only the condition mentioned in the "if" block is not matched.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
	Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
	The primary difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable as opposed to lists which are mutable.

Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?
	tup = ()

Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.
	No. We can't add elements to a tuple because of their immutable property. 

Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?
	No. There's no append() or extend() method for tuples, You can't remove elements from a tuple, also because of their immutability.

	set1.add("iNeuron")
	set1.add("Big")
	set1.add("data")
	set1.add(1)
	set1.add(1)
	set1.add(2)
	print(set1)

Q49. How is update() different from add()?
	We use add() method to add single value to a set. 
	We use update() method to add sequence values to a set. Here Sequences are any iterables including list , tuple , string , dict etc


Q50. What is clear() in sets?
	The clear() method removes all elements in a set.

Q51. What is frozen set?
	Frozenset is similar to set in Python, except that frozensets are immutable, 
	which implies that once generated, elements from the frozenset cannot be added or removed

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?
	Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python set object. 
	While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation

Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.
	The union() method returns a set that contains all items from the original set, and all items from the specified set(s)

	print(s1 | s2)
	OUTPUT ===> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.
	The intersection() method returns a set that contains the similarity between two or more sets.
	s1 = {1,2,3,1}
	s2 = {2,3,4,5,1}
	print(s1 & s2)
	OUTPUT ===> {1, 2, 3}

Q55. What is dictionary in Python?
	Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. 
	A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates

Q56. How is dictionary different from all other data structures.
	A dictionary is a general-purpose data structure for storing a group of objects. 
	A dictionary has a set of keys and each key has a single associated value. 
	A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

Q57. How can we delare a dictionary in Python?

	The get() method returns the value for the specified key if the key is in the dictionary

Q63. What is the use of items() function?
	The items() method returns a view object that displays a list of dictionary's (key, value) tuple pairs.
	e.g [(key1,value1),(key2,value2),..]

Q64. What is the use of pop() function?
	The pop() method returns the item present at the given index. This item is also removed from the list.

Q65. What is the use of popitems() function?
	Python dictionary popitem() method removes the last inserted key-value pair from the dictionary and returns it as a tuple.

Q66. What is the use of keys() function?
	The keys() method returns a view object. The view object contains the keys of the dictionary, as a list.

Q67. What is the use of values() function?
	The values() method returns a view object. The view object contains the values of the dictionary, as a list.

	A for loop in Python is a control flow statement that is used to repeatedly execute a group of statements as long as the condition is satisfied.

Q69. How many type of loop are there in Python?
	There are two types of loops in Python, for and while. (Nested for loop)

Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?
	for ==> A for loop is a single-line command that will be executed repeatedly.
	while ==> While loops can be single-lined or contain multiple commands for a single condition.

Q71. What is the use of continue statement?
	The continue keyword is used to end the current iteration in a for loop (or a while loop), and continues to the next iteration.

Q72. What is the use of break statement?
	'Break' in Python is a loop control statement. It is used to control the sequence of the loop

Q73. What is the use of pass statement?
	The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code. 
	When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed

Q74. What is the use of range() function?
	The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.

Q75. How can you loop over a dictionary?
	By using a for loop.
	e.g : for key,values in dict1.items():
